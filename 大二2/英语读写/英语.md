# Basic Structure of an Argumentative Essay

## What is an argumentative essay?

make a claim about a topic and justify this claim with specific evidence.

the claim could be an opinion ,a policy proposal ,an evaluation ,a cause-and-effect statement ,or an interpretation.



## The structure of an argumentative essay

### A clear ,concise and defined thesis statement that occurs in the first part of the essay

tasks:

- Set the context
- State why the main idea is important
- State the thesis/claim(thesis claim)   (sound reasoning,pathos,ethos)



hook(attract people,grab the readers attention)$\to$bridge(transition)$\to$thesis



six types of hook:

- generalization
- common misperception
- fact or statistic
- question
- anecdote
- quote



### Clear and logical transitions between the introduction,body,and conclusion

wrap up the idea from the previous section and introduce the idea that is to follow in the next section

two elements included in an organization of an argumentative:

- the order in which different parts of the discussion or argument are presented
- the relationship constructed between these parts



transitions make the organization clearer and easier to follow



### Body part with evidential support

each paragraph be limited to the discussion of one general idea



### Logic in argumentation

two basic types of reasoning processes: deduction and induction

a deductive argument depend upon: ①agreement about the general principle with which the argument begins ;②the special application must be correct and clear ,with no disputes about its validity ;③the conclusion must be derived properly from putting these two together

the basis of all induction is the repeated observation



### A conclusion that does not simply restate the thesis ,but readdresses it in light of the evidence provided

effective and logical

don't introduce any new information





an argumentative essay may consist of:

- **introduction**
- **Support**
- **counter-argument(optional)**: introduce the strongest argument against the author's claim
- **refutation(optional)**: explain why the counter-argument is wrong
- **conclusion**

# Reading Report Rules

- Be constructively critical of the articles. 
- Be accurate in your constructive critical comments. Where necessary, say how you think  the articles might have been organised and/or argued better – and why.



## The Article Summarizer

Your report should include the thesis statement, topics that support the thesis statement, and supporting details. 

take about 3 minutes

## The Questioner

derive FOUR discussion questions from the article which may be of two  kinds:

- Questions on aspects of the article that you predict the group may find unclear and  for which they may wish further clarification (e.g. , vocabulary, idiom, sentence structures)
- Questions which invite critical thinking & discussion about issues raised by the article (e.g. , different positions, culture implications)

These will serve as the starting points for our  group discussion.

## The two Clarifiers

Your job will be to attempt to provide clarification to issues which are raised by the  questioner and which come from the other students during the discussion. 

work closely with the questioner beforehand in order to prepare  responses to questions posed.

must be able to answer any questions about  the content that the other students pose.

## The Discussion summarizer

:Your job will be to monitor the information given by  those in roles 1-4 and to close our review of the article with a brief summary of the main  points arising from the session as a whole.
